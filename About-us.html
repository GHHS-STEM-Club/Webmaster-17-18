								<h2>The Team</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/About2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The history of Andromeda Intelligence Machines (AIM) began in September of 2017, in a small computer lab at Gig Harbor High School, with a small idea from a small group of four friends. Their idea was to reach beyond the stars, and achieve a goal that could change the course of humankind. But before AIM was even thought of, the backstory of the companions stretched all the way back to elementary school and their names were Mitch Huber, Travis Hand, Dylan Rosenlind and Nicholas Adrian. They met each other circa Second and Third grade and attended school together all the way from Kindergarten to Senior Year in Highschool. The four grew up in a technical world, and each of them stemmed an affinity for learning about and using technology.</p>
								<p>Their first real experience in a technological competition was in their 6th grade year in the club that was newly introduced to the school, known as the club for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) the team competed at a statewide level in website design and scored fourth place, which was almost enough to qualify for nationals in Dallas, Texas. The following year they suffered many setbacks and landed at firth place overall. Learning from their mistakes, the team came back and won first place overall their eighth grade year and traveled to Orlando, Florida to compete nationally. The following year the team felt they were ready for a new challenge, and focused their time and effort on coding to learn about AI. Later that same year, they took their first AI program to state, and won first place, then proceeded to win first place at Nationals. But they did not stop there. They left the club, and created a private club of their own called “Andromeda” and began work on the world's first Ultra-Intelligent AI. For five long years, the team worked tirelessly to code the AI, and on October 5 2022, when the team conducted test number 249 speaking to the AI, it finally spoke back to them. Fast forward another 5 years, and the team is a group of successful businessmen who own one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies ever.</p>

								<h3>What We Learned at the Last State Competition:</h3>
								<p>We learned that hard work and dedication will produce a better product than talent when talent doesn't work hard. After scoring fourth and fifth place for our first two state competitions, hard work and dedication led us to a first place victory. With that experience, we plan to succeed for a second time in a row.</p>
